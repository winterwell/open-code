Dictionary files almost fit the UTX Basic format.

??Or should we go with Google's csv format??

As such, they should start with a UTX glossary information line, such as:

	#UTX 1.11ish; en/fr; 2012-09-24; copyright:Winterwell (2012); license:CC-BY 3.0
	
And a tab-separated column definition line, such as:

	#src	tgt	src:pos
