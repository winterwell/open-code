# Data Artifact Depot

It's a key-value store with rich keys (e.g. use a POJO), controllable distribution, support for modular artifacts, & versioning. 

It can back-end onto any key-value store -- including the file-system (with scp for distribution).  

Ideal for data-science.

## Features

 - Store most any POJO. 

 - Modular artifacts: Big complex artifacts get broken down into smaller modules.
 
 - Artifact Versioning: 
 	- Create multiple versions of a model using different setups. 
 	- Use sym-links to reference the latest/best version.
 	
 - Nice handling of Files.
