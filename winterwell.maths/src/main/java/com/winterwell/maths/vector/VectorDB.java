 * TODO Problem: how to perform nearest-neighbours search against a store of

 * 
 * Solutions: - index a random subspace - index the high eigenvectors - cluster,
 * then use clusters?? - hash buckets? or ordering? (hash buckets seem to be
 * more popular) Parameter Sensitive Hashing (PSH) The trick: Estimate
 * performance of different hash functions on examples
